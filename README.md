# Mathematica-3D-Christmas-tree
Using mathematica to draw a 3D Christmas tree, you can export the model and use it for AR on your phone. 
The 3D tree model.usdz is the model you can use for AR playing. 
The Christmas tree notebook is for generating the tree. There's two versions in it. The original version may get a little messy when exporting to .usdz file. The transformed version is especially optimized for iPhone, and it can export the right version of usdz file. 
WARNING: exporting to usdz file via Mathematica may go red on a Windows system. Try to use a MacOS system if you can.
